  m_text: 'In Unity, there are several built-in tools and features that can help
    with game design:


    1. Scene View: The Scene View is a 3D preview window
    where you can see your current scene from different angles. This view allows
    you to move objects around, adjust lighting and environmental effects, and test
    out your level designs.


    2. Hierarchy: The Hierarchy panel displays all
    the objects in your scene, arranged in a hierarchical structure. This tool lets
    you quickly select and manipulate individual objects, as well as parent them
    to other objects for complex hierarchy management.


    3. Inspector: The Inspector
    panel allows you to view and edit the properties of selected objects. You can
    use this feature to adjust object positions, rotations, scales, and other parameters
    in real-time.


    4. Project Browser: The Project Browser lets you browse and
    organize all your assets, including textures, models, sounds, and scripts. This
    tool makes it easy to find and reuse assets across multiple scenes or projects.


    5.
    Asset Store: Unity''s Asset Store is an online marketplace where you can buy
    or download additional assets, such as 3D models, animations, sound effects,
    and other resources. These tools can save you time and effort in creating your
    own assets from scratch.


    6. Scripting: If you want to add custom functionality
    or mechanics to your game, Unity supports both C# and JavaScript scripting languages.
    You can use these tools to create complex behaviors, AI algorithms, and other
    advanced features.


    These tools should provide a solid foundation for most
    game design needs, but there are also third-party plugins and extensions available
    that can add additional functionality or streamline your workflow. Let me know
    if you need any further guidance or resources as you begin designing your game
    in Unity!'
