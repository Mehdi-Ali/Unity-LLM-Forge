      a specific function keep in mind that use Unity and c#DO NOT MENTION ANY EXPLANATIONS
      if not asked\nWrite a Unity Editor script.\n - It provides its functionality
      as a menu item placed \"Edit\" > \"Do Task\".\n - It doesn\u2019t provide any
      editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item is invoked.\n
      - Don\u2019t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.\n - There is no selected
      object. Find game objects manually.\n - I only need the script body. Don\u2019t
      add any explanation.\n - Do not over engineer stuff and make the script as
      simple as possible \n - To Create and / or Instantiate primitive objects you
      need to call the function through UnityEngine.Object.Instantiate(), example
      of a cube creation: GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube) \n - DO
      NOT mention any explanations.\n - always include the code between ```csharp
      and ``` .\n - Use this template:\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing UnityEditor;\r\n\r\npublic
      class GeneratedScript_temp : EditorWindow\r\n{\r\n    [MenuItem(\"Edit/Do Task\")]\r\n   
      private static void DoTask()\r\n    {\r\n        // an example of creating
      a primitive cube:\r\n        GameObject cube = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);\r\n
