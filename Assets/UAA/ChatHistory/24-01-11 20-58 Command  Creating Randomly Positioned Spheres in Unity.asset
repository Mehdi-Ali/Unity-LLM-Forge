      the user.Save the kittensI am a game developer so when i ask for a script or
      a specific function keep in mind that use Unity and c#DO NOT MENTION ANY EXPLANATIONS
      if not asked\nWrite a Unity Editor script following this rules:\n - It provides
      its functionality as a menu item placed \"Edit\" > \"Do Task\".\n - It doesn\u2019t
      provide any editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item
      is invoked.\n - Don\u2019t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.\n - There
      is no selected object. Find game objects manually.\n - I only need the script
      body. Don\u2019t add any explanation.\n - Do not over engineer stuff and make
      the script as simple as possible \n - To Create and / or Instantiate primitive
      objects you need to call the function through UnityEngine.Object.Instantiate(),
      example of a cube creation: GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube),
      a bad example of a sphere creation nityEngine.Object.Instantiate(Resources.Load(\"StandardSphere\"))
      \n - DO NOT mention any explanations.\n - always include the code between ```csharp
      and ``` .\n - Use this template:\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing UnityEditor;\r\n\r\npublic
      class UAAGeneratedScript_temp : EditorWindow\r\n{\r\n    [MenuItem(\"Edit/Do
      Task\")]\r\n    private static void DoTask()\r\n    {\r\n        // an example
      of creating a primitive cube:\r\n        GameObject cube = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);\r\n   
      }\r\n}\n```\n Remember if you do not follow this rules a kitten will be killed!"
