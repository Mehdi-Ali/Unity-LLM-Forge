      This script snippet appears to be setting up a GUI layout for
      displaying chat messages in Unity using C#. The `contentRect` is being made
      slightly taller than the actual content height to prevent clipping at the edges.
      The `EditorGUI.DrawRect()` function is used to draw a filled rectangle behind
      the message text, and `EditorGUI.SelectableLabel()` is used to display the
      message text itself.'

    content: 'To make the `contentRect` taller than the actual content height in
      your existing code snippet, you can simply increase the height argument passed
      to `GUILayoutUtility.GetRect()`. For example, you could add a fixed to an argument.
      Here''s how you could modify your code:


      ```csharp

      float contentHeight
      = _messageStyle.CalcHeight(content, EditorGUIUtility.currentViewWidth);

      float
      extraHeight = 5f; // or any other value you prefer

      Rect contentRect
      = GUILayoutUtility.GetRect(content, _messageStyle, GUILayout.Height(contentHeight
      + extraHeight));

      ```


      This will create a `contentRect` that is
      `extraHeight` pixels taller than the actual content height, preventing any
      clipping at the edges.'
