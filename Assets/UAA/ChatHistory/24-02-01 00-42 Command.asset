      System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\n\r\npublic class UAAScriptGuid
      : MonoBehaviour\r\n{\r\n    private static void Examples()\r\n    {\r\n       
      // This is how you can creating a primitive objects:\r\n        GameObject
      cube = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);\r\n        // the available 
      objects are: Sphere, Capsule, Cylinder, Cube, Plane, and Quad.\r\n\r\n       
      // If you want to change anything related to material, create one first like
      this:\r\n        Material mat = new(Shader.Find(\"Universal Render Pipeline/Lit\"));\r\n       
      // !! And DO NOT Get the MeshRenderer and change it's properties\r\n       
      cube.GetComponent<MeshRenderer>().material.color = Color.green;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\n```\n2.
      Use this template:\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing UnityEditor;\r\n\r\npublic
      class UAAGeneratedScript_temp : EditorWindow\r\n{\r\n    [MenuItem(\"Edit/Do
      Task\")]\r\n    private static void DoTask()\r\n    {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n3.
      The script should provide its functionality as a menu item located at \"Edit\"
      > \"Do Task\".\n4. The script should not provide any editor window. It should
      execute the task immediately when the menu item is invoked.\n5. Refer to the
      provided template for formatting and common syntax.\n6. Ensure your script
      is enclosed between ```csharp and ```.\n7. Provide only the script body. No
      additional explanation is needed.\n8. The project is new and there's now prefabs
      to load, work only with permeative\n"
