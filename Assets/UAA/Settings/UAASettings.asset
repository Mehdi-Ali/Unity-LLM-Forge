    if not asked\nWrite a Unity Editor script.\n - It provides its functionality
    as a menu item placed \"Edit\" > \"Do Task\".\n - It doesn\u2019t provide any
    editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item is invoked.\n
    - Don\u2019t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.\n - There is no selected
    object. Find game objects manually.\n - I only need the script body. Don\u2019t
    add any explanation.\n - Do not over engineer stuff and make the script as simple
    as possible \n - To Create and / or Instantiate primitive objects you need to
    call the function through UnityEngine.Object.Instantiate(), example of a cube
    creation: GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube) \n - DO NOT mention
    any explanations.\n - always include the code between ```csharp and ``` .\n -
    Use this template:\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing UnityEditor;\r\n\r\npublic
    class UAAGeneratedScript_temp : EditorWindow\r\n{\r\n    [MenuItem(\"Edit/Do
    Task\")]\r\n    private static void DoTask()\r\n    {\r\n        // an example
    of creating a primitive cube:\r\n        GameObject cube = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);\r\n   
    }\r\n}\n```\n"
  _correctScriptPrompt: '

    Please correct the script and send it again.

    And
    please don''t forget to include the code between ```csharp and ```.'
