      Simplify the next
      command to a list of small simple tasks following this format: - Task 1: do
      something. - Task 2: do something else -... '
    _taskToScriptPrompt: "write a Unity Editor script following these guidelines:\n1.
      Use this script for syntax and guids:\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\r\nusing
      System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\n\r\npublic class UAAScriptGuid
      : MonoBehaviour\r\n{\r\n    private static void Examples()\r\n    {\r\n       
      // This is how you can creating a primitive objects:\r\n        GameObject
      cube = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);\r\n        // the available 
      objects are: Sphere, Capsule, Cylinder, Cube, Plane, and Quad.\r\n\r\n       
      // If you want to change anything related to material, create one first like
      this:\r\n        Material mat = new(Shader.Find(\"Universal Render Pipeline/Lit\"));\r\n       
      // !! And DO NOT Get the MeshRenderer and change it's properties\r\n       
      cube.GetComponent<MeshRenderer>().material.color = Color.green;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\n```\n2.
      Use this template:\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing UnityEditor;\r\n\r\npublic
      class UAAGeneratedScript_temp : EditorWindow\r\n{\r\n    [MenuItem(\"Edit/UAA
      - Unity AI Assistant/Execute\")]\r\n    private static void DoTask()\r\n   
      {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n3. The script should provide its functionality
      as a menu item located at \"Edit\" > \"Do Task\".\n4. The script should not
      provide any editor window. It should execute the task immediately when the
      menu item is invoked.\n5. Refer to the provided template for formatting and
      common syntax.\n6. Ensure your script is enclosed between ```csharp and ```.\n7.
      Provide only the script body. No additional explanation is needed.\n8. The
      project is new and there's now prefabs to load, work only with permeative\n"
    _correctScriptPrompt: 'Please correct the script and send it again.

      And
      please don''t forget to include the code between ```csharp and ```.'
