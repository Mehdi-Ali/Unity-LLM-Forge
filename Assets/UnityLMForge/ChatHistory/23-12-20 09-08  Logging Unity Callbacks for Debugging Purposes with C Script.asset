  - role: assistant
    content: "Here's a basic script in C# that logs all Unity callback functions
      using the Debug.Log() method:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing
      System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class CallbackLogger
      : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    void Start()\n    {\n        Application.logMessageReceived
      += HandleLog;\n        QualitySettings.reloadingApiCallback += HandleQualitySettingsReloading;\n       
      Time.timeScaleChanged += HandleTimeScaleChanged;\n        PlayerPrefs.KeyChanged
      += HandlePlayerPrefsKeyChanged;\n        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);\n   
      }\n\n    void OnEnable()\n    {\n        LevelOfDetailGroup.changedLevelOfDetailGroups
      += HandleLodGroupsChanged;\n    }\n\n    void OnDisable()\n    {\n        LevelOfDetailGroup.changedLevelOfDetailGroups
      -= HandleLodGroupsChanged;\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        ScriptInvocationMethod[]
      callbacks = ReflectionUtil.GetAllMethodsWithAttribute<InvokeCallbackAttribute>(typeof(MonoBehaviour));\n       
      foreach (ScriptInvocationMethod callback in callbacks)\n        {\n           
      Debug.Log(\"Unity Callback: \" + callback.MethodInfo.Name);\n        }\n   
      }\n\n    void HandleLodGroupsChanged()\n    {\n        Debug.Log(\"LevelOfDetailGroup
      Changed\");\n    }\n\n    void HandlePlayerPrefsKeyChanged(string key)\n   
      {\n        Debug.Log(\"PlayerPrefs Key Changed: \" + key);\n    }\n\n    void
      HandleTimeScaleChanged(float timeScale)\n    {\n        Debug.Log(\"Time Scale
      Changed: \" + timeScale);\n    }\n\n    void HandleQualitySettingsReloading()\n   
      {\n        Debug.Log(\"Quality Settings Reloading\");\n    }\n\n    void HandleLog(string
      logString, string stackTrace, LogType logType)\n    {\n        Debug.Log(\"Unity
      Log: \" + logString);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this script, we're using the `CallbackLogger`
      class to log callback functions by registering them with their respective event
      handlers in Unity. The `HandleLodGroupsChanged()`, `HandlePlayerPrefsKeyChanged()`,
      `HandleTimeScaleChanged()`, and `HandleQualitySettingsReloading()` methods
      handle specific callbacks, while the `HandleLog()` method handles the general
      `Application.logMessageReceived` event.\n\nThe `Update()` function logs all
      Unity callback functions using reflection to obtain a list of all methods with
      an `InvokeCallbackAttribute`, which is applied to most Unity callback functions.
      This script can be added as a component to any object in your scene to log
      all Unity callbacks for debugging purposes.\n\nNote that this script may generate
      many logs, especially during gameplay, so it's best used in debug builds or
      during development and testing stages."
