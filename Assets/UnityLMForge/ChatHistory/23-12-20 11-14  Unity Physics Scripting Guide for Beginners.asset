  - role: assistant
    content: "Sure, here's a simple C# script for Unity that you can use as a starting
      point:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing
      UnityEngine;\n\npublic class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour {\n    // Start
      is called before the first frame update\n    void Start() {\n        Debug.Log(\"Hello,
      World!\");\n    }\n\n    // Update is called once per frame\n    void Update()
      {\n        // This function is called every frame\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis script
      creates a new class named `ExampleScript`, which inherits from the `MonoBehaviour`
      class that Unity provides. The script contains two functions: `Start()` and
      `Update()`. The `Start()` function is called when the script is enabled, while
      `Update()` is called every frame. In this example, we're simply logging a message
      to the console using the `Debug.Log()` function. Feel free to modify or expand
      upon this script as needed for your project!"

      class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour {\n    // Start is called before the first
      frame update\n    void Start() {\n        Debug.Log(\"Helloo My World!\");\n   
      }\n\n    // Update is called once per frame\n    void Update() {\n        //
      This function is called every frame\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let
      me know if you have any further questions or requests."
